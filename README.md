*What should I Read?*

Don't ask yourself this question no more. There is something to help you now. This Twitter bot will help you pick a good book every day.

**How it does it?**

Simple: Once a day,everyday it will search the <a href="www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> database, using their API and will select one random author, chosing one of his book with that has a rating more tahn 3.8(used to be 4 but I found a lot of good books have 3.8 or 3.9).

This bot was made using <a href="www.nodejs.com">nodejs</a>,<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/goodreads-api-node">goodread-api-node package</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit
">twit package</a> and hosted on <a href="www.heroku.com">heroku</a> and of course the most important a bit of love and dedication :)  

Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or chat.
